      <h2>Museo-ilocos-norte</h2>
      <p> Museo Ilocos Norte is situated in Laoag, Ilocos Norte. It is an excellent representation of the rich heritage of Ilocos and the ethnography of the Ilocanos, Igorots, Itnegs, Yapayaos and other ethnicities of the province.

      This museum in the Philippines is housed in an existing Tabacalera, or tobacco warehouse, close to the Provincial Capitol. The warehouse used to be a plain brick structure, one of the chains of brick structures built in Ilocos during the 19th century. The Tabacalera was then converted into an enthralling two-story museum.

      From the old household implements to farming equipment to the ancient bahay na bato house models to the significance of garlic in their lives, a trip to the Ilocos Museum is a visual treat. </p>

      <h2>Sm Laoag City</h2>
      <p> Laoag’s coastal desert, this mall celebrates local heritage and culture.” was stated on the SM Supermalls website.[5]

      SM City Laoag houses SM's anchor tenants, including SM Supermarket, SM Store, SM Cinema, and SM Appliance.

      Located in the north wing is Dap-Ayan Park, a small recreational area that includes a paw park, playground, rock tower art, and decorative pinwheels. Sky Ranch remains in the planning stages. However, its construction has not been confirmed by SM themselves, but it is still possible.[6] Additionally, the mall features a prominent LED billboard positioned at its front façade.</p>
