          <h3>bagnet_buo</h3>
          <p>is boiled and deep-fried to achieve the crispy, crunchy pork skin. It's a cross between crispy pata and lechon kawali, both of which have crispy meat that is not too dry. It involves boiling pork chunks in water until they are tender, then the meat is removed. The water is left to boil until only the fatty oil remains. They add a bit of lard to the same pot and the pork is fried in its own oil until the skin becomes tough. It is fried to perfection until the skin becomes crunchy cracklings or chicharon.</p>
